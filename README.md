# ESP32-ArtnetWifi-SDreadwrite-clock
With this project its possible to drive Ws2812 Leds with Artnet over Wifi (with Jinx! or Glediator) and itÂ´s also possible to switch to the SD-card version where animations can be recorded from Artnet and than be played back. Although a Matrix-clock can be switched on and off over the animations.

I am a passionate technician and like to build and create works of art. Over the last few years, I have decided to combine technic with art and experimenting with this things will never end.
I've been working with light and light objects since my childhood and got an insight into programming in my school days. Unfortunately, my knowledge is still not as good and with the grate help of Yves Bazin i got this cool work of art.
