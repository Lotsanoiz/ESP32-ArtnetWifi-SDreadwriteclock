# ESP32-ArtnetWifi-SDreadwrite-clock
With this project its possible to drive Ws2812 Leds with Artnet over Wifi (with Jinx! or Glediator) and itÂ´s also possible to switch to the SD-card version where animations can be recorded from Artnet and than be played back. Although a Matrix-clock can be switched on and off over the animations.

I am a passionate technician and like to build and create works of art. With the grate help of Yves Bazin i got this cool work of art real. For this project you will need the latest artnet library from Yves Bazin which you can find here:
https://github.com/hpwit/artnet

Here you are the mounted matrixsreen on the wall.

To get enough space on my ESP32 (D1 Mini) i had to respace the partition.
These are the settings which worked fine with my controller:
in Arduino >> hardware >>espressif>>esp32>>partitions you have a file default.csv make a copy of that file
then copy that instead inside the "default.csv"

#Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags

nvs,      data,   nvs,    0x9000,   0x5000,

otadata,  data,   ota,    0xe000,   0x2000,

app0,     app,    ota_0,  0x10000,  0x200000,

app1,     app,    ota_1,  0x210000, 0x101000,

eeprom,   data,   0x99,   0x311000, 0x1000,

spiffs,   data,   spiffs, 0x312000, 0xEE000,

//it will reduce the OTA and the SPIFF size and extend the flash size to  3mo when it will compile

then we need to tell Arduino that you have increase that
open the file
arduino>>hardware>>expressif>> board.txt
find you board name for instance I am using "ESP32 Dev module"
esp32.name=ESP32 Dev Module
esp32.upload.tool=esptool
esp32.upload.maximum_size=2097152  <= ,normally you have 1310720
so instead of 1310720 put 2097152

I am open for every idea or improvements to the code.
